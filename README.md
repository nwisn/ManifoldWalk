## About

An algorithm in python and Mathematica to simulate a random walk on a Riemannian manifold of probability distributions, with the Fisher information matrix as the metric tensor. This random walk simulates the usual sampling distribution predicted by asymptotic estimation theory, for use in various numeric integrations. Our implementation is specifically for the manifold of multivariate Gaussian distributions, but it is generalizable to other families provided the Euler-Lagrange equation is known (the analytic solutions for many different families are derived in Mathematica notebooks inside the github directory). It is useful for studying the asymptotic properties of more complicated statistics in diffusion tensor imaging, such as the fractional anisotropy (and other tensor invariants).
